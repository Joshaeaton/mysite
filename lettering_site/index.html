			    	<h3>What is Javascript?</h3>
			    	<p>You probably heard about JavaScript before. It borrows the name of the popular programming language Java, and it has a catchy sound to it. That's why the name was chosen!

It supports object-oriented programming and procedural programming. It can be used to control web pages on the client side of the browser, server-side programs, and even mobile applications. This language is used commonly in combination with HTML, CSS, and AJAX.</p>

			   		<h3>Plugins for jQuery</h3>
			   		<p>A jQuery plugin is simply a new method that you use to extend jQuery's prototype object. By extending the prototype object you enable all jQuery objects to inherit any methods that you add. As established, whenever you call jQuery() you're creating a new jQuery object, with all of jQuery's methods inherited. The idea of a plugin is to do something with a collection of elements. You could consider each method that comes with the jQuery core a plugin, like .fadeOut() or .addClass().
