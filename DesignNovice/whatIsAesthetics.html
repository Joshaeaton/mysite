         <h1>What is aesthetics?</h1>
         <p>Aesthetics, is basically how or why things catch our eyes, and give us pleasure to look at them. It is absoloutly crucial for web designers to know this and understand it, as it will be a major factor in the ammount of traffic our sites will get, along will how long users can stand looking at the site. I remember a few sites personally that I have gone to, taken one look, and said NOPE! Even if they were perfect functioning sites, because they didnt look professional, it was enough for me to not even bother with them.</p>
