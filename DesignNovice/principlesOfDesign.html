        <h1>Principles of Design</h1>
        <p>
            <dl>
                <dt><b>Contrast</b></dt>
                    <dd>the juxtaposition of opposing elements by way of using different colors, tones, directions, lines, shapes,ext. to show emphasis. You could use contrast in a variety of ways such as bolding the title of a page and making the navigation bar slightly less emphasized. Basically it is emphasizing the most important part or parts of the site. </dd>
                <br>
                <dt><b>Emphasis</b></dt>
                    <dd>happens when attention is focused on a single area within a design, to assist the viewer in understanding visually that this particular area is more important than the other areas within the design. You can easily accomplishment this using typographic hierarchy which is a specific way of using fonts to create a sense of flow. It is important to be consistant with this using bolding, and font sizes as well as other elements. You can also do this with colors, images, and fonts.</dd>
                <br>
                <dt><b>Balance</b></dt>
                    <dd>occurs in a design when the elements of the page as a whole have a feeling of equality of weight. for instance if you have a baby blue text and light green background you wouldnt want to put a bunch of really dark images on the page.</dd>
                <br>
                <dt><b>Unity</b></dt>
                    <dd>the pleasing arrangement of parts within a composition, the relationship between the individual parts and the whole of the design used creatively to express a particular idea or emotion.</dd>
                <br>
                <dt><b>Pattern</b></dt>
                    <dd>offers you a way to keep your design organized as well as providing a sense of harmony through the use of repeating elements. A pattern can be as easy to create multiple elements that are the same size, like thumbnail graphics on a gallery page, you could also use pattern in the form of repeating shapes.</dd>
                <br>
                <dt><b>Movement</b></dt>
                    <dd>refers to the suggestion of action or direction, since nearly all graphic design is two-dimensional. On the web, however we can work with both implied and actual movement. For instance implied movement can be done with a image. Where actual movement can be achieved though the use of animations or with a stationary element while the rest of the page scrolls.</dd>
                <br>
                <dt><b>Rhythm &amp; repitition</b></dt>
                    <dd>occurs when one or more elements in a design are repeated often enough to create a visual rhythm.</dd>
                <br>
                <dt><b>Proportion</b></dt>
                    <dd>the visual relationship between two or more things in terms of their size, number, or degree it goes hand in hand with emphasis and unity.</dd>
                <br>
                <dt><b>Simplicity</b></dt>
                    <dd>deals with the elimination of any non-essential elements or details to reveal the essence of a form. The more attractive page will almost always use simplicity. Always take out things that don't fit with the rest of the page.</dd>
                <br>
                <dt><b>Gradation</b></dt>
                    <dd>any gradual change in the design that occurs by a series of stages, steps, or degrees where there is an obvious visual shift from one state to another you could use color to show this effect going from dark to light. You can also do this with images making them grow when you hover over them</dd>
