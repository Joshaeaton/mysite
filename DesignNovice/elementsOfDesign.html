        <h1>Using Elements Of Design</h1>
        <p>
            According to Lynda.com there are 8 different elements of design, although it was mentioned that there is some debate on that subject(seems like there is alot of that in the web community).
        <dl>
            <dt><b>Color</b></dt>
            <dd>which effectivly sets the websites mood/feel for the website</dd>
            <br>
            <dt><b>Value</b></dt>
            <dd>which is the lightness or darkness of the colors on your page this also can effectivly change the mood. For example bright red like a coke can, gives the user the feeling of excitement and passion. Where a darker shade of the red, like a wine red, can give you the feeling of a relaxing, upscale atmosphere</dd>
            <br>
            <dt><b>Texture</b></dt>
            <dd>which is usually a tactile look that gives depth to a otherwise one dimentional page.There is a trend right now for flat design but that doesnt mean that texture is irrelivant as understanding it will allow you to give dimention to a otherwise flat bland page.</dd>
            <br>
            <dt><b>Shape</b></dt>
            <dd>Shapes are usually self contained defined areas, positive shapes can be used for buttons and navigation bars. Negative shapes are usually created in the space between two or more forms.</dd>
            <br>
            <dt><b>Form</b></dt>
            <dd>Form is the overall sum of shapes within your design and how they relate to one another. Good form would be a design in which everything looks like it goes together</dd>
            <br>
            <dt><b>Space</b></dt>
            <dd>space refers to whitespace. It is important to use a decent amount of space in your page to give the users eyes a place to rest, a cluttered page is a hard to read page.</dd>
            <br>
            <dt><b>Line</b></dt>
            <dd>line is any mark, path, mass, or edge. These can be used for orginizing your page and sections on your page as well as borders, backgrounds, and can even give the illusion of movement.</dd>
            <br>
            <dt><b>Type</b></dt>
            <dd>which refers to the type and color of the fonts. Using the right font can also communicate the mood to the target audience.</dd>
