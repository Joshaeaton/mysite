         <p>
            At the heart of a responsive web design is a set of custom CSS styles specifically for different-sized devices
            <ul>
                <li>Smart phones</li>
                <li>Tablets and touch computers</li>
                <li>Laptops and ultrabooks</li>
                <li>Desktops</li>
                <li>Internet ready TVs</li>
                <li>Web enabled game devices</li>

            Grids allow you to easily work with these systems allowing you to easily work with rations, use whitespace effectivly, and align elements easily. When designing a site it should be harmonious and working with grids is one way to do this allowing you to easily manipulate all of your elements and get a visual feel on the contrast between elements.
